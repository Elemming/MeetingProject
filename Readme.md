Project was made for the Exercise at the bottom of the document

I have worked with the assumesion that an email is some text followed by a @ follow by some text, and all meeting as scheduled in the same timezone.
Addinally then my recommendations will always be between 8 and 16 o'clock where no users in the meeting has another meeting, but the System allows for meetings igorene these constraints.

Was I making the exercise for extendability then I would have made it in more class and split more up instead of a giant switch statment and would likely have implemented it as a full state machine instead.



---------- Programming exercise start ---------------

Exercise: Scheduling App

Design and implement the API for a minimal scheduling application. This API should be able to handle the following requirements:

1) Create persons with a name and unique email.

2) Create meetings involving one or more persons at a given time slot.

3) A meeting can only start at the hour mark and only last exactly one hour.

4) Show the schedule, i.e., the upcoming meetings, for a given person.

5) Suggest one or more available timeslots for meetings given a group of persons.

You should not implement a GUI, a simple unit test or console demo should suffice. Also please try to keep the number of third party libraries to a minimum. Finally, please do not spend time on storing data in files or databases.

The exercise should be solved in Java, Scala or C++.

The estimated work effort for this exercise is 3-4 hours. If you make any implementation compromises, please make sure to document those.

Please share the code in a github repository or similar.

---------- Programming exercise end ---------------
